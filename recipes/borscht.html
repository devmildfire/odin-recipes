    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Borscht is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. 
       In English, the word "borscht" is most often associated with the 
       soup's variant of Ukrainian origin, made with red beetroots as one
        of the main ingredients, which give the dish its distinctive red
        color. The same name, however, is also used for a wide selection
        of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as sorrel-based 
        green borscht, rye-based white borscht, and cabbage borscht. </p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>

        <li>Place sliced potatoes and beets in a medium saucepan 
            over high heat; cover with stock, and boil until
             vegetables are tender. Remove potatoes and beets
             with a slotted spoon, and reserve stock.</li>
        
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

            are tender, about 10 minutes.</li>
